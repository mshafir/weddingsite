<p>
Please come share the moment we first enter marriage!
We will be getting married near the water at Baku Palace.
We would be honored to celebrate together.
</p>

<p>
When we asked each other what was the most important thing about
imagining a wedding together, we wanted to be surrounded by people
who have been part of our lives and our familyâ€™s lives back through
the years, who helped bring us to this day.
</p>

<p>
We will gather at Baku Palace to join our lives together in the
presence of family and community.
